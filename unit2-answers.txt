## Socket Programming General True or False Statements
# Question 'ab': True or false: The connect() function for the C programming language is used by a server to connect to a client
ab=f
# Question 'ac': True or false: The recv() function for the C programming language is less flexible than the recvfrom() function.
ac=f
# Question 'ad': True or false: The send() function for the C programming language performs the same function as write(), but without the possibility to set flags.
ad=f
# Question 'ae': True or false: Socket programming refers to programming using the network sockets software abstraction
ae=t
# Question 'af': True or false: The accept() function for the C programming language accepts all waiting network sockets each time it is called.
af=f
# Question 'ag': True or false: The accept() function for the C programming language changes a network socket that is waiting for network connections into an active connection.
ag=t
# Question 'ah': True or false: The listen() function for the C programming language marks a socket as `passive', ready to accept new connections.
ah=f
# Question 'ai': True or false: A network socket usually contains addressing information for layer 3 and layer 4
ai=t
# Question 'aj': True or false: The write() function for the C programming language is used to write the address information into a socket.
aj=f
# Question 'ak': True or false: The accept() function for the C programming language checks for newly received socket connections.
ak=t
# Question 'al': True or false: The socket() function for the C programming language sets the address of a network socket
al=t
# Question 'am': True or false: The bind() function for the C programming language connects a network address to a network address
am=f
# Question 'an': True or false: The read() function for the C programming language can only be used to read from sockets.
an=f
# Question 'ao': True or false: The listen() function for the C programming language causes a socket to actively connect via the network to listen for applications that require it.
ao=t
# Question 'ap': True or false: The read() function for the C programming language can be used on both servers and clients.
